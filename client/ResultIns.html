        After completing the puzzles, you can now reflect on how this kind of scenario could play out in real life. 
        <br><br>
        When people come from different backgrounds and put their unique pieces together, there will be times when you might not have the right background. Sometimes the best step to solving a problem is recognizing what you don’t know and opening the door for others to fill in the gaps. (graphic: wheel in a red bucket)
        <br><br>
        Other times, you may be the key to solving the puzzle! You can share your experiences with others and maybe even teach them a thing or two. (graphic: wheel in a green bucket alone)
        <br><br>
        Sometimes you may share a background with others. This can be helpful to be able to discuss the situation with someone who has the same identity to give multiple perspectives. (graphic: two wheels filling a green bucket)
        <br><br>
        However, sometimes you have different views even when you share an identity. Part of working with others is recognizing that sometimes another person’s experience may be more pertinent. (graphic: wheel in a yellow bucket, wheel with same trait nearby)
